<p><strong>The Rotary Airlock Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drop-Through Rotary Valves</li><li>Blow-Through Rotary Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Rotary Airlock Valves market features two primary types: Drop-Through and Blow-Through Rotary Valves. Drop-Through Rotary Valves facilitate the downward flow of bulk materials, ensuring controlled discharge while maintaining pressure differences. They are ideal for applications needing gravity-fed processes. Blow-Through Rotary Valves, on the other hand, allow for pneumatic conveying systems, where materials are pushed through by air pressure. This design is suited for conveying lightweight materials over longer distances, ensuring efficient transport without loss of integrity.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photochromic Glasses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Substrate Siscoloration Glasses</li><li>Film-Changing Glasses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photochromic glasses market is divided into two main types: substrate discoloration glasses and film-changing glasses. Substrate discoloration glasses undergo a chemical reaction within the lens material itself, allowing them to darken or lighten in response to UV light exposure. In contrast, film-changing glasses utilize a thin photochromic film applied to a non-photochromic lens, providing a similar response to light but often with flexibility in design. Both types enhance user comfort by adapting to varying light conditions, promoting eye protection.</p></p>
